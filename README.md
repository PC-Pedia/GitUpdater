GitUpdater [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/72cvetqe8awtp2fn)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Walkman100/gitupdater)
=================================================================================================================================================

A simple application written in VB.NET to update all your repos with one click, or one repeatedly until it works.

Command Line
============

The syntax to launch GitUpdater from the command line is:
```shell
gitupdater.exe [-gitcmd=<push|pull|(any git command)>] [-gitwhat=<all|selected|notselected|cmdselected|cmdnotselected>] [-dir=<repos parent folder>] [-repo=<repo name>] [run]
```
some examples are:

`gitupdater.exe -gitcmd=push -gitwhat=cmdselected -repo=GitUpdater run`

`gitupdater.exe -gitcmd=pull -gitwhat=cmdnotselected -repo=YTVL run`

`gitupdater.exe -gitcmd=pull -gitwhat=all run`

Note that if you use either of the `selected` or `notselected` options, it will say that no item has been specified, since those methods use the selection in the GUI. Please use the <i><b>cmd</b>selected</i> and <i><b>cmd</b>notselected</i> methods.

Note also that the way this has been programmed allows you to put multiple commands after each other:
`gitupdater.exe -gitcmd=push -gitwhat=cmdselected -repo=GitUpdater run -gitcmd=pull -gitwhat=cmdselected -repo=YTVL run`

Also note that any git command can be used in place of `push|pull`, they can be put in any order (but it is recommended to use the specified order), and anything that doesn't begin with one of the predefined flags will be ignored. This allows for a command like this:

`gitupdater.exe -repo=GitUpdater -gitcmd=show ouiocuiygcrdackdacrdi -gitwhat=cmdselected run`

This will execute the `git show` command in the `GitUpdater` repo.

**Please note that the `run` flag is necessary to run the program, and if it is put before any other parameters they will not be used.**
Also note that this can be used to launch GitUpdater in a specific repo parent folder:

`gitupdater.exe -dir="C:\Users\Matthew\GitHub"`

If your repos are located in that folder.

Perform Git commands at a scheduled time
========================================

To do this you use an external program to launch GitUpdater with command line args (please see [above](#command-line) for an explanation of them).

An external program that you can use is Windows itself, using the Windows Task Scheduler:

1. Press <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd> & <kbd>R</kbd>

2. Type `taskschd.msc` or copy and paste, then press enter

3. In the window that opens, in the pane on the left click on 'Task Scheduler Library' or expand it and click on the folder where you want to make the task.

4. Click on the option in the pane on the right that reads 'Create Task...'

5. Give the task any name you want. Click on the tab 'Triggers', then the 'New...' button.

6. Set when you want the task to start.

7. Click 'OK', then go to the 'Actions' tab and click 'New...'

8. Click 'Browse...' and locate the GitUpdater executable.

9. In the 'Add arguments (optional):' box add the arguments you want, e.g. `-gitcmd=pull -gitwhat=all run` or `-gitcmd=push -gitwhat=cmdselected -repo=GitUpdater run`

10. Click 'OK', 'OK' again, then close the Task Scheduler window.
